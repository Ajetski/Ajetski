<h2 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Adam Jeniski</h1>

- 🌱 I’m currently in a greener lispy pasture & self hosting all the things (goodbye github, hello gitea)
- 🎁 giving and recieving gifts (the magic of open source)
- 🤔 Looking into:
    - playing with [Carp](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp) lang. (For small lispy binaries with no GC requirement)
    - Property Based Testing, Quickcheck, [test.check](https://clojure.org/guides/test_check_beginner), [rapid](pgregory.net/rapid), etc
    - Hypermedia based web, [D*](https://data-star.dev/)
    - writing non-dead programs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ab3ArE8W3s)
- 📫 How to reach me <a href="mailto:ajensiki4@gmail.com">Email</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/adamjeniski">LinkedIn</a>
    - no inquiry about AI, web3, or blockchain start ups 🤦‍♂️
    - this is ONLY here for that unicorn clojure senior dev looking for some more firepower 😉

### My favorite tools at the moment (non-exhaustive)
- THE REPL.
- Editor: Neovim & Conjure.nvim
- Language: Clojure, Rust

### Disclaimer, moving repos
- Personal repos are for code exploration and subject to be deleted on a whim
- Moving deployed and actively maintained projets to <a href="https://git.ajet.fyi/ajet-industries">Ajet Industries</a>
